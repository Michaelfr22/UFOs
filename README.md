# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to build on foundational javascript knowledge by deploying an interactive webpage that features a dynamic table. Based on user inputs for key filters, the table will update with responses that meet the user-inputted criteria. Observers can narrow down their searches using the filters!

### Tools
 - javascript
 - CSS styling
 - Bootstrap

### Key Filters
 - Date
 - City
 - State
 - Country
 - Shape

## Drawbacks and Recommendations

 - **Drawback**: Web design is still somewhat basic and one-dimensional, clearly the work of a beginner front-end developer.
 - **Rec 1**: Design the filter labels in a way that visually connect to their matching column header, possibly by font/size/color.
 - **Rec 2**: Include more images that link to sites with complementary and supporting information. Provide a link to the original data source.
